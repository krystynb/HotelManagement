# HotelManagement

All files except Prog4.java, trans1.txt, and hotels1.csv were authored by Krystyn Bondad.
The specified files above were authored by Jose Cordova.

The driver program reads in the hotels to be managed from hotels1.csv and manipulates the members and their respective fees dependent on the information in trans1.txt.

Some potential actions are:
- adding guests to certain hotels
- retrieving the guests accummulated fees
- finding the hotel in which a guest is staying, if at all
- removing guests from hotels
- listing the number of guests at a particular hotel
- and more!
